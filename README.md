### Big Data Analytics:
1. **Calculus** for Gradient Descent
2. **Gradient descent** implementation, as well as **Elastic Net Regularization** based Regression implementation, both with PySpark.
3. **Linear Regression** implementation to conduct Servo Motor Analysis, Regularized Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementation using **TF-IDF** pipelines, both in PySpark. 
4. **Unsupervised learning** with K-Means clustering in PySpark.
5. Implementation of **CNN**, **RNN**, and **LSTM** on PyTorch; **Multi-layer Perceptron** on PySpark.
6. **Project:** Multi-class classification of handwritten [A-Z], [a-z], and [0-9] characters using Random Forest (with and without eigenvector decomposition and PCA), and Multi-layer Perceptron implemented on PySpark in Databricks environment.
