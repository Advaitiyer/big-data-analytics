### Big Data Analytics:
1. Calculus for Gradient Descent
2. Gradient descent implementation, as well as Elastic Net Regularization based Regression implementation, both with PySpark.
3. Linear Regression implementation to conduct Servo Motor Analysis, Regularized Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementation using TF-IDF pipelines, both in PySpark. 
4. Unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering in PySpark.
5. Implementation of CNN, RNN, and LSTM on PyTorch; Multi-layer Perceptron on PySpark.
6. Project: Multi-class classification of handwritten [A-Z], [a-z], and [0-9] characters using Random Forest (with and without eigenvector decomposition and PCA), and Multi-layer Perceptron implemented on PySpark in Databricks environment.
